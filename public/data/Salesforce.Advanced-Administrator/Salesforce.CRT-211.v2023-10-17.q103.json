A roll-up type is a function that determines how the data from the child records is aggregated and displayed on the parent record.

A price book is a list of products and their prices that can be added to an opportunity. An opportunity can have only one price book at a time, and the products that are available for selection depend on the price book that is chosen.

Therefore, the administrator should check if the new keyboard product is added to the appropriate price book that is used by the opportunity.\n The other two options are incorrect because:\n Making custom fields does not affect the availability of products on an opportunity. Custom fields are used to store additional information or calculations on an object, but they do not determine which products can be selected from a price book.\n Turning on field tracking does not affect the availability of products on an opportunity.

For example, if the change set includes a new custom object, the administrator should also include the object permissions, field-level security, page layouts, and record types for that object.\n Run deployment validations on the change set in the sandbox prior to uploading to production. This can help test the change set for any errors or conflicts before deploying it to production. Deployment validations simulate the deployment without actually making any changes and report any issues or warnings.\n The other two options are incorrect because:\n Cloning a change set does not add forgotten dependent components to an uploaded change set. It only creates a copy of the existing change set that can be modified before uploading.\n When deploying a new record type, it is not necessary to have it as the only component in the change set. It can be deployed along with other components as long as they are compatible and have the required dependencies."

    "answer": "A",
    "title": "Question 100",
    "explanation": "A permission set is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various tools and functions in Salesforce. A permission set can be used to extend users' functional access without changing their profiles. You can assign permission sets to individual users or groups of users based on their business needs. In this case, you can create a permission set with Read access to the Government ID field on the custom object and assign it to the Institutional Team users who need access to this field via reports.

The log shows up to 20 fields of information for each change, such as who made it, when it was made, what type of change it was, and what values were changed. You can use the Setup Audit Trail to track configuration changes directly in production and identify any unauthorized or problematic changes. One of the changes that the Setup Audit Trail tracks is when a user's profile is changed and who changed it. This means that you can use the Setup Audit Trail to see when a user's profile has been changed and who changed the data.

    "answer": "C,D",
    "title": "Question 102",
    "explanation": "Change sets are tools that allow administrators to move customizations such as fields, page layouts, profiles, permission sets, etc. from one Salesforce org to another. To use change sets, administrators need to establish a deployment connection between a source org (such as a sandbox) and a target org (such as production). Then, administrators can create an outbound change set in the source org that contains the components they want to deploy, and upload it to the target org. In the target org, administrators can view and validate the inbound change set before deploying it to their org. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.changesets.htm&type=5"

    "answer": "D",
    "title": "Question 103",
    "explanation": "When creating a new custom object, administrators can choose to mark it as deployed or in development. If an object is marked as in development, it is not visible to users or available in tools such as Data Loader, even if they have access to it through their profile or permission set. To make the object available for data import, the administrator needs to mark it as deployed. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.customize_deployment_status.htm&type=5"
