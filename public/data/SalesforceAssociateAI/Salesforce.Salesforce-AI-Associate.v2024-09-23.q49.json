      "A. Predictive AT uses machine learning to classify or predict outputs from its input data whereas generative Al does not use machine learning to generate its output.",
      "B. Predictive Al uses machine learning to classify or predict outputs from its input data whereas generative Al uses machine learning to generate new and original output for 4 given input",

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "title": "Question 36",
    "explanation": "Predictive AI and generative AI represent two different applications of machine learning technologies.\n Predictive AI focuses on making predictions based on historical data. It analyzes past data to forecast future outcomes, such as customer churn or sales trends. On the other hand, generative AI is designed to generate new and original outputs based on the learned data patterns. This includes tasks like creating new images, text, or music that resemble the training data but do not duplicate it. Both types of AI use machine learning, but their objectives and outputs are distinct. For detailed differences and applications in a Salesforce context, Salesforce's guide on AI technologies is a helpful resource, accessible at Salesforce AI Technologies."

    "answer": "A",
    "title": "Question 40",
    "explanation": "AI assists in lead qualification primarily by scoring leads based on customer data. This process, known as lead scoring, uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate leads against a set of predefined criteria that reflect potential interest and sales readiness. The scores assigned help sales teams prioritize their efforts toward leads most likely to convert, thus improving efficiency and success rates in sales activities. Salesforce AI enhances this process through features like Einstein Lead Scoring, which automatically calculates scores based on both historical conversion data and behavioral data from prospects. For further insights, Salesforce provides detailed documentation on lead scoring with AI at Salesforce Einstein Lead Scoring."

    "answer": "A",
    "title": "Question 41",
    "explanation": "Neural networks are a key AI tool designed as a web of interconnected nodes, similar to the human brain's structure. Each connection, or synapse, in a neural network is guided by weights and biases that are adjusted during the learning process. These weights and biases determine the strength and influence of one node over another, facilitating complex pattern recognition and decision-making processes. Neural networks are extensively used in machine learning for tasks like image and speech recognition, among others. For more on neural networks in the context of Salesforce AI, see the Salesforce AI documentation on Neural Networks."
